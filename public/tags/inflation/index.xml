      <title>Dark matter and the oscillating inflaton</title>

We currently study the perturbative decay of the inflaton as it oscillates about its minumum, assuming the small-field limit of its potential has the form $V(\Phi) = |\Phi|^k$. By keeping track of the non-instantaneous decay, the evolution of effective masses, and the dependence of the decay rate on the final state, we compute the evolution of the instantaneous temperature during reheating, and the production rate of dark matter at the early stages of reheating. So far results are only available for the decay of the inflaton into a pair of fermions. Non-trivial effects arise for both freeze-in and freeze-out dark matter production mechanisms.
&lt;p&gt;In the future we will look at the effect of thermal corrections on rates, the thermalization of the decay products, and non-adiabatic, non-perturbative particle production. In the context of UV-dominated dark matter freeze-in models, these effects have not yet been considered for non-quadratic potentials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supersymmetric Higgs inflation</title>

&lt;DIV align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
The &#39;$\mu\nu$SSM&#39; is a supersymmetric extension of the Standar Model which includes three right handed neutrino superfields. These couple to the Higgs field and, upon developing vaccum expectation values after electroweak symmetry breaking, generate effective mass terms for Higgsinos, solving the $\mu$-problem. Moreover, their coupling to Standard Model neutrinos, and to themselves, generates Majorana masses, leading to an electroweak-scale seesaw. Hence, the only scale in the $\mu\nu$SSM is the electroweak scale. We currently investigate if the incorporation of (Higgs) inflation into the model retains this key feature.

      <title>How warm are non-thermal relics?</title>

The light emitted from distant quasars excites the Lyman-$\alpha$ transition in the intergalactic medium. The spectral redshift between the reference frames of the light source and the absorber provides the position of the hydrogen cloud along our line of sight. This allows the measurement of the matter power spectrum at scales ~ Mpc, and imposes constraints on the allowed masses of a thermal warm dark matter candidate. If it is too light, it will not be sufficiently cold (non-relativistic) during structure formation, washing out structure due to its considerable velocity dispersion. 
&lt;p&gt;We investigate the power spectrum of Non-Cold Dark Matter (NCDM) produced in an out-of-equilibrium state (from the decay of scalar condensates, of thermalized and non-thermalized particles, and from thermal and non-thermal freeze-in). We have found that the cutoff scale in the power spectrum is solely determined by the equation-of-state parameter $w$, and propose a mapping procedure to translate the Lyman-$\alpha$ bound on the WDM mass to NCDM scenarios without the need for numerical computations. By applying this procedure we find non-trivial bounds on NCDM candidates, ranging from $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim {\rm EeV}$ for dark matter production from inflaton decay with a low reheating temperature, to sub-keV values for non-thermal freeze-in.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the great advances made to date by CMB observatories, we don&#39;t know yet which model of inflation operated in the early Universe. Embeddings of inflation into extensions of the Standard Model tend to be complex, involving many fields and complicated interactions (this is the case for string and supersymmetric models). Particle production during inflation could have then be driven by non-periodic, non-adiabatic interactions, which are stochastic and uncorrelated due to expansion
of the Universe. In the limit of many fields/interactions, emergent universal properties arise: a fine-tuned arrangement of parameters is not necessary, and even a random distribution in the landscape of initial conditions/couplings can lead to viable models. Statistical tools are necessary, akin to those utilized to describe electron transport in wires, and stock and derivative pricing in finance. 
&lt;p&gt;If stochastic particle production occurs during inflation, field amplitudes grow by performing geometric (Brownian) random walks in cosmic time, sourcing the primordial curvature fluctuation. The resulting power spectrum can mimic the nearly-scale invariant, featureless spectrum measured in the observable CMB window, and yet contain features of varied size and width outside this window. These peaks in the power spectrum will lead to gravitational collapse at certain length scales, and therefore source the production of primordial black holes in the early Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;
