We consider several models of inflation to delineate the conditions for which $c_s = 0$. In models with unconstrained superfields, we argue that the mixing of the goldstino and inflatino in a time-varying background prevents the uncontrolled production of the longitudinal modes. This conclusion is unchanged if there is a nilpotent field associated with supersymmetry breaking with constraint ${\\bf S^2} =0$, i.e. sgoldstino-less models. Models with a second orthogonal constraint, ${\\bf S(\\Phi-\\bar{\\Phi})} =0$, where $\\bf{\\Phi}$ is the inflaton superfield, which eliminates the inflatino, may suffer from the over-production of gravitinos. However, we point out that these models may be problematic if this constraint originates from a UV Lagrangian, as this may require using higher derivative operators. These models may also exhibit other pathologies such as $c_s  1$, which are absent in theories with the single constraint or unconstrained fields.","tags":null,"title":"Slow and Safe Gravitinos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos A.

Embeddings of inflation into extensions of the Standard Model tend to be complex, involving many fields and complicated interactions (this is the case for string and supersymmetric models). Particle production during inflation could have then be driven by non-periodic, non-adiabatic interactions, which are stochastic and uncorrelated due to expansion of the Universe. In the limit of many fields/interactions, emergent universal properties arise: a fine-tuned arrangement of parameters is not necessary, and even a random distribution in the landscape of initial conditions/couplings can lead to viable models. Statistical tools are necessary, akin to those utilized to describe electron transport in wires, and stock and derivative pricing in finance. If stochastic particle production occurs during inflation, field amplitudes grow by performing geometric (Brownian) random walks in cosmic time, sourcing the primordial curvature fluctuation. The resulting power spectrum can mimic the nearly-scale invariant, featureless spectrum measured in the observable CMB window, and yet contain features of varied size and width outside this window.

We make use of the transfer matrix formalism to parametrize the evolution of the system in terms of the occupation number,  and two phases associated with the transfer matrix; these are used to construct the evolution of the spectator field. Assuming short-time interactions approximated by Dirac-delta functions, we numerically track the change of these parameters and the field in all regimes: sub- and super-horizon with weak and strong scattering. In all cases a log-normally distributed field amplitude is observed, and the logarithm of the field amplitude approximately satisfies the properties of a Wiener process outside the horizon.

During inflation, the vacuum remains in the unbroken GUT phase, and GUT symmetry breaking occurs later when a field with a flat direction (the flaton) acquires a vacuum expectation value. Inflaton decay and the reheating process depend crucially on GUT symmetry breaking, as decay channels open and close, depending on the value of the flaton vacuum expectation value. Here, we consider the simultaneous cosmological evolution of both the inflaton and flaton fields after inflation. We distinguish weak, moderate and strong reheating regimes, and calculate in each case the entropy produced as all fields settle to their global minima. These three reheating scenarios differ in the value of a Yukawa coupling that introduces mass mixing between the singlets and the ${\\bf 10}$s of SU(5). The dynamics of the GUT transition has an important impact on the production of gravitinos, and we also discuss the pattern of neutrino masses we expect in each of the three cases.

We discuss possible patterns of soft supersymmetry breaking, exhibiting examples of the pure no-scale type $m_0 = B_0 = A_0 = 0$, of the CMSSM type with universal $A_0$ and $m_0 \\neq 0$ at a high scale, and of the mSUGRA type with $A_0 = B_0 + m_0$ boundary conditions at the high input scale. These may be combined with a non-trivial gauge kinetic function that generates gaugino masses $m_{1/2} \\neq 0$, or one may have a pure gravity mediation scenario where trilinear terms and gaugino masses are generated through anomalies. We also discuss inflaton decays and reheating, showing possible decay channels for the inflaton when it is either an untwisted matter field or a Kähler modulus. Reheating is very efficient if a matter field inflaton is directly coupled to MSSM fields, and both candidates lead to sufficient reheating in the presence of a non-trivial gauge kinetic function.","tags":null,"title":"Phenomenological Aspects of No-Scale Inflation Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Ellis","Marcos A.

While models of inflation with a quadratic potential may be constructed in simple $N=1$ supergravity, these constructions are more challenging in no-scale supergravity. We discuss here how quadratic inflation can be accommodated within supergravity, focussing primarily on the no-scale case. We also argue that the quadratic inflaton may be identified with the supersymmetric partner of a singlet (right-handed) neutrino, whose subsequent decay could have generated the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.","tags":null,"title":"Resurrecting Quadratic Inflation in No-Scale Supergravity in Light of BICEP2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Ellis","Marcos A.

This is the well-known eta problem in inflation. The same effect gives masses along low energy flat directions of the scalar potential thus potentially preventing Affleck-Dine baryogenesis to occur. It has been shown that adding a chiral multiplet $S$ coupled to the inflaton (with a shift symmetry) can serve to stabilize the inflationary potential and allows one to derive simple inflationary potentials without an eta problem. Here, we show that by coupling the same stabilizing field $S$ to the flat direction, may naturally lead to a negative mass-squared contribution to the flat direction thus generating the necessarily large vacuum expectation value needed to realize Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. We trace the evolution of the inflaton, stabilizer, and flat direction field, as well as a Polonyi-like modulus responsible for soft supersymmetry breaking.","tags":null,"title":"Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis and Inflation in Supergravity with Strongly Stabilized Moduli","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos A.
